Creating THE BEST ICE CREAM EVER (Flavor Component Analysis)
This project will analyze data on various ice cream flavors to identify patterns in ingredients, customer preferences, and flavor combinations that contribute to well-accepted and popular flavor profiles. By examining top-rated flavors across multiple brands, I aim to uncover the elements that make flavors resonate with consumers. Using these insights, I will provide recommendations for future flavor profiles that have the potential to become fan favorites.

Data Usage
I will be using the "Ice Cream Flavors dataset" available on Kaggle.
The dataset contains detailed information on 241 flavors, including brand, flavor names, ingredient lists, average ratings, customer reviews (with star ratings and review text), and product descriptions.
Here is the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tysonpo/ice-cream-dataset/data?select=bj
(The CSV file for the dataset is also attached in this Jupyter notebook.)
