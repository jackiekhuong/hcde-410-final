    "# Goals + Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to understand what customers like about specific brands and flavors of ice cream to create \"The Best Ice Cream Ever\" both as a flavor profile and flavor description. As a self-proclaimed ice cream enthusiast with over 20 years of ice-cream reviewing experience, I am looking to invent the best ice cream flavor from a crowd-sourced scientific standpoint.Im sure there are ingredients in ice cream that are needed to make the product come together, but there are also \"nice-to-haves\" which I will be figuring out what those ingredients are through this study. By analyzing data on customer sentiment towards certain flavor profiles as well as \n",

    "# Research Questions:\n",
    "Creating the Flavor:\n",
    "- What ingredients and flavor combinations are most strongly correlated with high ratings in ice cream flavors?\n",
    "- What commonalities can be found in the ingredients of top-rated flavors from each brand?\n",
    "- Are positive sentiments in reviews more focused on taste, texture, uniqueness, or other factors?\n",
    "Creating the Description:\n",
    "- What commonalities can be found in the flavor descriptions of top-rated flavors from each brand?\n",
    "- What language or sentiment in customer reviews correlates with higher ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hypothesis:\n",
    "- Flavors with chocolate might be more popular.\n",
    "- Customers might be inclined towards flavors with interesting mix-ins (cookie dough, chocolate chips, swirls, etc...)\n",
    "- Flavor descriptions with words such as \"Creamy\", \"Rich\", or other indulgent words might rank higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Previous Research\n",
    "Currently there are very few if any academic papers published on the topic of finding the single best ice cream flavor. However, there are studies that have been done on more niche categories such as the best flavors within the \"Better for You\" category (L.R. Sipple). There are also studies that have been done on determining the best vanilla ice cream, or analyzing aspects of ice cream such as taste and texture. The past research, specifically the one analyzing the best in the \"Better for You\" category provides good insight in adgacent ways I could measure customer perception of ice cream. Overall there is a lot of research surrounding the fat content and relative mixture to create the \"Best Ice Cream\", however is little about the best flavor combination with regards to base flvor, swirls, and mix-ins which is what I aim to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of non-academic journals there have been a number of articles raking different ice-cream flavors. One in particular I found which influence my hypothesis was one from the Internation Dairy Foods Association, \"Ice Cream Trends Survey with America’s Top Flavors, Toppings, and Ways to Eat Ice Cream\". This article provided initial insight into current flavor trends and preferences for toppings which could potentially be related to mix-in preferences. They found Chocolate to be popular among their study participants as well as caramel as a swirl.\n",

    "# Data selected for analysis:\n",
    "The data I've selected for this project is from Kaggle. It is a data set that provides insight about various products (ice creams) from Ben & Jerry's, Häagen-Dazs, Breyers, and Talenti. These insights include the flavor names, descriptions, ingredients, ratings, and more. Furthermore, the dataset also provides customer reviews of these ice creams with comments they had on the flavor. The data was collected from the brand websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods\n",
    "First I will filter my data to focus on top-rated ice creams those with an average rating above 4.5/5 stars. From there I will check the data for duplicates, handle NA values, and preprocess text data to work better with my analysis (lowercaing everything, removing punctuation, etc...). \n",
    "\n",
    "For figuring out the flavor itself, I plan to use the ingredient lists from the data and identify the most commonly used ingredients across top-rated flavors from each brand. From this, I will create bar-chart visualizations to identify these trends and draw comparisons between brands. This will reveal the building blocks of popular flavors, helping to define the base flavor profile. Furthermore, another option would be to find correlations between base flavors and mix-ins that are popular using a co-occurrence analysis to determine which combinations appear most frequently in high-rated flavors. This could highlight pairings like chocolate-and-fruit or vanilla-and-nut— understanding how certain ingredients pair can help design complementary and well-balanced flavors. Ultimately, I will holistically review all of these visualizations to find key trends and use them to influence my ingredient list for \"The Perfect Ice Cream.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For figuring out the description for this perfect ice cream, I will then go back and review all the descriptions for the top-rated flavors with the ingredients from my perfect ice cream flavor. Additionally, I may go through customer sentiments for these flavors and use sentiment analysis to determine what common words were associated with positive reviews. I will find the most common words and create a word tree to use as a vocabulary box while drafting a new description of my flavor. Ultimately, positive language plays a big role in marketing and it can influence sensory and emotional responses among ice-cream lovers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step-by-step:\n",
    "1. Perform a frequency count to identify the most commonly used ingredients across top-rated flavors.\n",
    "2. Create visualizations like bar charts or word clouds to present the findings.\n",
    "3. Look at co-occurrences of ingredients (e.g., chocolate + caramel, vanilla + nuts) to identify popular pairings.\n",
    "4. Tokenize and extract the most common words or phrases in flavor descriptions for top-rated ice creams. (Focus on adjectives and sensory words (e.g., creamy, indulgent, rich).)\n",
    "5. Also find common \"positive adjectives\" used to describe top-rates ice creams through customer sentiment reviews. (OR perform a sentiment analysis to confirm the most common positive themes (e.g., mentions of \"texture,\" \"flavor balance,\" or \"nostalgia\").\n",
    "6. A proposed flavor profile using the top ingredients and combinations.\n",
    "7. A draft flavor description using the most impactful language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unknowns and dependencies\n",
    "One specific concern that should not be overlooked is that some of the data was collected through a promotion which could be a confounding factor of whether or not this is the true sentiment of the person. This should be addressed as a short coming of my study. \n"
